 have created a one-click activation system for your backend. You no longer need to type single commands in multiple terminals.

🚀 How to use it:
Go to your main project folder: C:\CareFusion-AI
Double-click the new file: START_BACKEND.bat


🛠️ What this script does:
AI Engine Check: It automatically checks if Ollama is running and starts it if it's missing.
Backend Launch: It opens a new window and starts your Node.js backend on Port 5000.
Vercel Bridge: It automatically starts the Localtunnel bridge so your Vercel site can connect to your computer.
As long as those two windows stay open, your Vercel site will be fully operational and able to "think" using your local AI modules.
